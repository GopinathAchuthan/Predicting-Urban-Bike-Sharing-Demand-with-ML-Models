# Predicting-Urban-Bike-Sharing-Demand-with-ML-Models

This project leverages machine learning techniques to predict bike-sharing demand in urban areas. By analyzing historical data from bike-sharing systems, the goal is to create accurate demand forecasts that can optimize bike availability and distribution, contributing to more efficient and sustainable urban mobility solutions.

The dataset includes various features such as weather conditions, time of day, day of the week, and seasonal factors, which are used to build predictive models. Through data exploration, feature engineering, and model evaluation, the project aims to uncover patterns and trends that influence bike-sharing demand.

Key techniques used in this project:
- Data preprocessing and feature engineering
- Time series analysis and trend analysis
- Machine learning models including Linear Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost
- Model evaluation using performance metrics like RMSE, MAE, and RÂ²

This project demonstrates how machine learning can be applied to real-world urban transportation problems, improving bike-sharing systems' efficiency and user experience.
